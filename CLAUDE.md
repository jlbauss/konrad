# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents working on Konrad's source. (Konrad's *runtime* agent
behavior lives in `image/opencode/`, not here.) Canonical homes for everything
else — link, don't restate: [README.md](README.md) (users) · [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
(dev + release process) · [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (design + *why*) ·
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (backlog) · [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (released changes).

Very important: ALWAYS read the above mentioned doc files once before you start planning or building, so they are in your context and you are able to follow the instructions they give.

## What this repo is

`bin/konrad` is a host CLI that runs [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) in
a sandboxed Podman container. The image is the canonical artifact; the CLI is the
primary consumer. Full design: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Validating a change (no automated tests)

```sh
shellcheck bin/konrad image/entrypoint.sh scripts/*.sh        # lint — keep clean
bash -n <script>                                              # parse check
konrad-dev --rebuild && ./scripts/smoke-test.sh konrad:local  # build + smoke
konrad-dev --shell                                            # poke around the image
```

Anything under `image/` is baked and needs `konrad-dev --rebuild` before it takes
effect (skills, agents, `environment.md`, Dockerfile, deps). `bin/konrad`,
`scripts/`, and `.devcontainer/` are live — no rebuild. Dev loop and the
`konrad`/`konrad-dev` split: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Quick facts

- Config layering is `baked < org < user`, merged by [image/merge-config.js](image/merge-config.js): **objects merge, arrays replace.** So add agent rules via `AGENTS.md`, never by overriding the `instructions` array — the org `AGENTS.md` is the one exception (appended post-merge so array-replace can't drop it). Rationale: [ARCHITECTURE.md → Configuration & instructions](ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration--instructions).
- Runtime environment — tool inventory, the `/opt/venv` Python venv (`uv pip install` to extend), Debian renames (`fd`→`fdfind`, `bat`→`batcat`), locale — is manifested in [image/opencode/environment.md](image/opencode/environment.md).
- Bundled skills live in `image/opencode/skills/` (`do-it-manually`, `spreadsheets`, `pdf`, `quality-assurance`); `quality-assurance` is the cross-skill verification cycle every producer skill invokes before reporting. Fonts catalogue: [pdf/references/fonts.md](image/opencode/skills/pdf/references/fonts.md).
- The agent's runtime tool `permission`s have **one home** — the baseline in [image/konrad-defaults/opencode-defaults.jsonc](image/konrad-defaults/opencode-defaults.jsonc); agent files (`agents/*.md`) carry **only deltas** (they deep-merge over it). The model is sandbox-shaped, not action-scariness-shaped — `ask` only on `rm -rf`, `deny` only the escape vectors, everything else `allow`. Don't re-add a full permission block to an agent. Rationale: [ARCHITECTURE.md → Configuration & instructions](ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration--instructions). (Not to be confused with the *host* Claude Code deny/ask lists in `.claude/` — a different layer, covered under Tooling & shell discipline below.)

## Working agreements

Durable rules for every agent in this repo — written here (not just in per-session
memory) so they travel with the repo to every machine. When the user gives a durable
rule or preference, add it here as a bullet — that's what this section is for.

### Naming & terminology
- "Konrad" the product, `konrad` the code: capitalized name in prose; lowercase in every command / path / image / package (`bin/konrad`, `~/.config/konrad/`, `ghcr.io/jlbauss/konrad`) — never recapitalize those.
- Say "quality assurance," not "QA," in prose under `image/opencode/`. Files kebab-case (`quality-assurance.md`), Python identifiers snake_case (`quality_assurance_helpers.py`).

### Docs
- One audience per file; one canonical home per fact; others link, never duplicate. The map is the Repository guide in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#repository-guide). User/project `AGENTS.md` overlays are additive, never replacements.
- When a ROADMAP item ships: add a terse [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) entry (Keep a Changelog) and delete the tier bullet, same commit. The changelog stays terse — rationale lives in the commit + ARCHITECTURE, never restated. Doc/CI/contributor-only changes (no `VERSION` bump) usually need no entry.
- Use the `docs(roadmap)` prefix for ROADMAP-only edits — agent commits append a one-line "what changed" note (no body); batch a session's edits and `--amend` before pushing, never after.

### Commits, versioning & release
- Canonical in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-style), [SemVer + the tag scheme](CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning), and the branch→develop→bump→merge flow. Agent deltas: the `Co-Authored-By` trailer is **mandatory** on agent commits; multi-line body for any design decision; separate commits per concern; bump `VERSION` as the last commit before merge.
- Two version mechanics to know: the README version badge auto-derives from `VERSION` (a shields *dynamic* badge — don't replace it with a hardcoded one); and CLI/image version drift on CLI-only patches is expected — `VERSION` bumps without firing an image rebuild (the `image/**` filter), and `konrad --version` prints both with no warning. Bundle a CLI change that genuinely needs a new image into one `image/**`-touching commit.
- **End-of-feature-branch handoff (and leave no stale branches).** `git push` is in the agent deny list, so when a feature branch is ready, *always* hand the user the exact ff-only sequence to run — don't make them ask: `git checkout main && git merge --ff-only <branch> && git push origin main && git branch -d <branch>` (append `git push origin --delete <branch>` only if it was ever pushed; local-only branches have no remote). That trailing `git branch -d` is what stops the *just-merged* branch from going stale — never omit it. To also catch *pre-existing* cruft, when you're finishing up in the repo, sweep: `git branch --merged main` → delete the merged leftovers with `git branch -d`; `git worktree list` → `git worktree prune` for any `prunable` entry. Never `-D` a branch that still has unmerged commits without asking — that work exists only in its branch. Canonical flow: [CONTRIBUTING → maintainer loop](CONTRIBUTING.md#branching-and-pull-requests).
- **Trivial edits skip the branch.** A contributor-only one-liner (a doc/rule tweak, no `VERSION` and no `image/**` change) can be committed straight to `main`; just hand over `git push origin main`. Reserve the branch→merge flow for actual changes. (After a handoff your shell may already be *on* `main` because the feature branch was merged + deleted out from under you — so for anything non-trivial, branch first rather than committing onto `main` by accident.)

### Editing safely
- Add an SPDX header to every **new or edited** source file: `# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Jan-Luca Bauß` + `# SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later` (vendored files keep their *upstream* header). The repo follows REUSE; `reuse lint` (in the dev container; CI-enforced on GitLab) must stay green. Canon: [CONTRIBUTING → licensing](CONTRIBUTING.md#what-youre-agreeing-to).
- Keep `bin/konrad` (and `image/entrypoint.sh`, `scripts/*.sh`) executable: a `644` `bin/konrad` breaks `konrad-dev`, so `chmod +x` after any rewrite that drops the bit and verify with `ls -l`.
- Validate smoke locally before pushing CI changes (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`, `image/Dockerfile`, `image/build-manifest.sh`): `konrad-dev --rebuild && ./scripts/smoke-test.sh konrad:local` beats a CI round-trip.
- Prefer `trash` over `rm` inside `/workspace` — it survives rebuilds and is recoverable (`trash-restore` / `trash-list`). `rm` hard-deletes; use it deliberately.

### Tooling & shell discipline
- Prefer the Read/Grep/Glob tools over `cat`/`grep`/`ls`/`find` in Bash — they never prompt and read cleaner than shell. When you do shell out, keep each call a single statement: no `echo "--- … ---"; cmd; echo` diagnostic chains, no `$(…)` / backticks, no `;` / `||` chains. Bundling clutters the transcript and turns an otherwise-safe call into one the permission matcher can't prove safe — one command per call, let the tool output speak.
- Permission posture: the devcontainer runs Claude with `defaultMode: bypassPermissions`, written by its `postCreateCommand` (`.devcontainer/setup-claude-permissions.sh`) to the **container-only** user settings `~/.claude/settings.json` (a named volume) — *not* the project `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is a host bind mount a bare-host run would also read. So the bypass is invisible outside the container and never committed; the disposable container, not the prompt, is the boundary. Keep `defaultMode` out of committed settings (it would override user scope). That user-scope default only reaches **terminal** `claude` runs — the VS Code extension passes an explicit `--permission-mode` CLI flag (which beats every settings file), so the extension panel gets its bypass from the machine-scope `claudeCode.*` settings in devcontainer.json's `customizations.vscode.settings` (also container-only: they live on the `.vscode-server` volume; pre-existing-volume caveat documented there). The committed `deny` list (`git push`, secret reads) and `ask` list still apply under bypass — notably `podman run` stays `ask`, since a raw `podman run -v …` against the host socket is the one command that can escape the container (and on rootful macOS reach your Mac home). So prompts are rare by design; if a *new* safe command prompts on a bare-host or teammate run (no bypass there), add a precise `Bash(<cmd>:*)` rule to the committed allowlist (the `fewer-permission-prompts` skill spots these) — never widen to cover `$(…)`.

### Self-testing the runtime (from the dev container)
- The `.devcontainer` mounts the host podman socket (`CONTAINER_HOST`), so `konrad-dev --rebuild` / `--shell` and workspace runs drive the host daemon directly. **Guard-rail: that's full host podman control (on macOS: root on the podman-machine VM) — no `--privileged`, no host-path mounts; `podman push` stays `ask`.** One-time prereq — Linux: `systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket`; macOS: the `dev.containers.dockerPath` shim wire-up in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (the daemon there is the VM's rootful one; `bin/konrad` swaps keep-id for explicit uid maps when `KONRAD_DAEMON_ROOTFUL=1`).
- End-to-end runs go through `./scripts/selftest.sh` (smoke test + a real `konrad run` through `bin/konrad`, asserted). It isolates state via `--profile selftest` and degrades to a SKIP on the model stage when no model/credential is usable, so it's safe to run blind — a red result means the runtime broke, not that setup is missing. **The default model comes from your own `~/.config/konrad` config** (the self-test mounts that layer into the runtime container, so it composes `baked < org < user` like a normal run) — set it where you'd set it for normal konrad. Override per run with `./scripts/selftest.sh --model <slug>` or `KONRAD_SELFTEST_MODEL=…` (any provider, not OpenRouter-locked). The raw primitive it wraps is `konrad-dev --profile selftest run [--model <slug>] "<prompt>"`. To exercise the model stage, the shared `konrad-secrets` volume needs a provider credential (`konrad-dev` → `/connect`); on macOS that's the rootful daemon's own secrets volume.

### Engineering ethos
- Lightweight, composed, low-maintenance; simple over clever; resist sprawl. Stack well-maintained building blocks over bespoke code; configure rather than ship code; drive maintenance toward zero. Treat surprising or illogical behavior as a smell to fix at the source, not work around. Flag any change that adds custom code, a new maintenance surface, or sprawl. Full statement: [ARCHITECTURE.md → Engineering ethos](ARCHITECTURE.md#engineering-ethos--lightweight-composed-low-maintenance).

### Working with the user
- Don't commit until the user has read your explanation: present the write-up, let them read it, wait for "go," *then* commit — except trivial, already-agreed mechanical commits.
